This document is a small guide of how to compile and run PyEGE in Windows

Requirments:
Visual Studio 2008
Python 2.6
Cython
All dependencies, see dependencies/dependencies.txt for locations of where they can be found.


How to build:
1. 
If you've installed python and cython in the default directories a file named 'cython.py' should be located in the directory C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\. Place 'ege.pyx' in this folder. 

2. 
Open cmd and run 
python cython.py ege.pyx
A file named 'ege.c' should've been created. Rename this file to 'ege.cpp'.

3. 
Follow the guide at 
http://docs.python.org/extending/windows.html#building-on-windows
to create a new project in Visual Studio 2008 for creation of a .pyd file.
Be sure to set
AdditionalOptions="/export:initege"
and
OutputFile=".\Release/ege.pyd"


4. 
Move the file 'ege.cpp' that was created in step 2. to the project's folder and include it as a source file.

5.
Include all source files from RakNet, located in [RakNet folder]\Source, as source files.

6. 
Include the following files to the project as include files
ConnectionHandler.h
Image.h
Sound.h
SoundHandler.h
Timer.h
WindowHandler.h

and the following files as source files:
ConnectionHandler.cpp
Image.cpp
Sound.cpp
SoundHandler.cpp
Timer.cpp
WindowHandler.cpp

7.
Add the following libraries to 'Additional Dependencies' in Configuration Properties->Linker->Input which can be found in the projects Property pages:
odbc32.lib odbccp32.lib python26.lib glfw.lib opengl32.lib glu32.lib DevIL.lib ILU.lib ILUT.lib GLee.lib fmodex_vc.lib ws2_32.lib
and add the following library to 'Ignore Specific Library' also located in Configuration Properties->Linker->Input:
LIBC.lib
(This is why the .pyd file cannot be built with pythons distutils. Please contact me if you find a way to build the .pyd file with distutils.)

8. 
Move the .pyd file to python's directory.

9. 
Install numpy, wxPython and xmpppy in the default directories.

10. 
Add chat.py to python's directory.


How to run just the engine:
1. 
ege is imported with
import ege

2. 
Firstly
ege.externalInitAll() 
must be called.

3. 
After that any ege function and class can be used. Be sure to call ege.update() each frame.

4. 
Before closing call
ege.externalCloseAll()


How to run the chat:
1. 
In cmd write
python chat.py
when you are located in python's directory.
