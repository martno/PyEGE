Play online:
Open the file chatClient.bat and login to the server. To register an account press the button Register.

Connect using a facilitator:
This is used if two players have problem connecting to each other. A third user must open the file startFacilitator.bat from cmd and two players can then connect to this server by specifying the facilitators IP when connecting through the chat client. Hopefully the two players will be able to connect.

Start offline game:
Open the file playOffline.bat from cmd.

Test multiplayer locally:
Start two instances of localPlay.bat. Start the server before the client. Type 's' and hit enter to start the server. Similarly start the client by typing 'c' an press enter.
